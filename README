A modification of apv pdfviewer:
http://code.google.com/p/apv/

It targets Android E-ink devices, specifically Nook2.

I've added some features:
1. Gamma adjustment
2. Memorize adjustment over page position.
3. Memorize adjustment over page position on Even/Odd pages.
4. Left,Right Tap action definition
5. Enlarged page number display
6. Partial/Full Refresh settings

The same as the original APV, it is licensed under GPL V3 or other compatible 
licenses.

How to build:
1. build the native librarys
scripts/build-native.sh
2. build project
1) specify your android sdk in local.properties
2) run ant debug
