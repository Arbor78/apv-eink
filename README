A modification of apv pdfviewer:
http://code.google.com/p/apv/

It targets Android E-ink devices, specifically Nook2. Modified by Bruce Li.

Personally speaking, this modification is just of my personal interest in the
hope that we'll have a better pdf reader for Nook2, feel free to e-mail me if
you're interested in it.

I've added some features:
1. Gamma adjustment
2. Memorize adjustment over page position.
3. Memorize adjustment over page position on Even/Odd pages.
4. Left,Right Tap action definition
5. Enlarged page number display
6. Partial/Full Refresh settings
7. Selectable A2 Mode during movement
8. Built-in A2Mode support
9. Watermark Removal

The same as the original APV, it is licensed under GPL V3 or other compatible
